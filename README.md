Lead Tracker

This is a chrome extension application in which you can track website leads. You can save them in the extension, and they will still be there once you refresh the page. You can also delete the website once finished. This is a great application if you are trying to find multiple website for certain ideas or purchasing items to compare prices.

Building this application helped me learn and better my undertstanding calling the DOM using addEventListeners in the JavaScript, and not the HTML. I learned how to use .innerHTML to input HTML in the javascript code, how to implements parameters and template literals in functions in order to write cleaner code, and used the .value function to track and save values. Another function i learned was the localStorage function and how to save items to the localStorage to work acros page refreshes, and how to pull them from the storage using setItem and getItem. Also, I learned how to use JSON.stringify to turn an array into a JSON array in order to store the data in a database while also using JSON.parse to fetch the string and turn it into a JavaScript array instead of the JSON array. Lastly, I learned about object in arrays, and how to fetch the array and the value of the object.
